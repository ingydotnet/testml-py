TestML is a meta language for defining software tests. It is
programming language agnostic and therefore can be implemented in any
programming language.

This project is a set of TestML tests for testing TestML itself. It is
an acting specification of TestML. An implementation that can make these
tests pass, can be considered complete.

These tests should be included in an implementation. One way to do this
using `git` is to use git submodules.
